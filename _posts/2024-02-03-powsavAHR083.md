* Eight AC outlets with four always on, four smart outlets and four USB-A ports. Looking up information online this looks to have a BK7321X chip so hopefully a good candidate to flash and convert to local control with integrations over ESPHome and Home Assistant.

# Device Info
* Model: AHR-083
* FCC ID: 2amxxahr083
## Acquisition
* Purchased from Amazon. ~$27.00 + Tax. Four Smart outlets, so roughly $7 per smart outlet. Cheaper than some of the alternative one plug smart outlets.

## FCC lookup
* Loking up the FCC ID online

## Internal Photos
* Looks like a WB3S Module

# Wireless Exploits
* Try to flash the power strip remotely first. If it doesn't work then will just open up and direct connect to read and write to the chip.
## Tuya-Cloudcutter
* https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter
	* "This repository contains the toolchain to exploit a wireless vulnerability that can jailbreak some of the latest smart devices built with the bk7231 chipset under various brand names by Tuya. "
* Setup local copy running on a raspberry pi 4b (8GB RAM)
## Results
* Worked through the prompts in Tuya-Cloudcutter

* After some restarts and connections through the prompts...

* **Did not work >> exploit unsuccessful**
* Plan B it is... Cracking it open

* Connectin the pins

# Firmware Dump
* Serial to USB converter connected up to computer and ltchiptool was used to interact with the WB3S module.
	* https://github.com/libretiny-eu/ltchiptool

## Chip Info
* Reading the chip info

![84b762ce8f8d894416bb518c61861bd0.png](/assets/84b762ce8f8d894416bb518c61861bd0.png)
* Looks like the bootloader version is `1.0.5` and the Cloud-Cutter version was expecting `1.1.8` so... maybe that's why it didn't work?

## Read Flash
* Saving the firmware

* Reading firmware back to get pin information and configurations

![45c7656781d15ff98e4f847f7fe8e1fd.png](/assets/45c7656781d15ff98e4f847f7fe8e1fd.png)

## Write ESPHome-Kickstart
* Instead of setting up a device in ESPHome and downloading the firmware to flash with the direct connection will try out the kickstart flash approach.
* Download the latest kickstart firmware
	* https://github.com/libretiny-eu/esphome-kickstart/releases/tag/v23.12.15
	* For this device select >> `kickstart-bk7231t-2023-12-15.uf2`
* Write the `kickstart-bk7231t-2023-12-15.uf2` to the chip using LTChiptool
* Power cycle the device and the WIFI AP should appear
* Connect to AP and the portal should open in the browser
* Enter Wifi for IOT network and once it joins it pops up in Home Assistant
* Add the device to integrations

# ESPHome
## ESPHome Config
* With the device added in Home Assistant final touches can be made to clean up config and add static WIFI address.

```yml

        - switch.toggle: switch_3
        - switch.toggle: switch_4
status_led:
  pin:
    number: P9
    inverted: true
```
* The device can be OTA updated since it is already integrated with Home Assistant

## ESPHome Operation
* After OTA check out the device and try out the relay controls in ESPHome Dashboard

# Final Thoughts
* Although couldnt get the Tuya-CloudCutter to work the direct flash method using ESPhome-Kickstart was straight forward. With having access to the pin information and the YAML output provided in LTChiptool it might be better to just build the config in ESPHome, download and flash the firmware to reduce the steps and files needed. 
* Powerstrip seems solid overall and look forward to having allways on options as well as individual switched outlets all on the same powerstrip.

# Second Chance - Tuya-CloudCutter
* Ordered a second one of these from amazon more recently than the first one. There might be a chance that this second one has a more up to date firmware that is compatible with the cloudcutter.
## Running CloudCutter
* Fresh build of docker image

* Prompt and selections

* Put device in slow blink mode and script connects and does it's magic. One physical power off and on required here.

* Made it to the final step! Flashing the ESPHome-Kicktart firmware!

## Connecting to new kickstart AP
* Connecting to AP and going to web browser
* In ESPHome, build a new device and copy the YAML settings from the other POWSAV power strip. Rename and change WIFI settings.

* Once OTA upload submitted `new device notification` pops up in Home Assistant
*  Accepting then integration and trying out the relays in ESPHome

![c5e38026eee61ebcbec83a0c80bf4abe.png](/assets/c5e38026eee61ebcbec83a0c80bf4abe.png)

* Looks successful and works as it should. Nice to not have to do a teardown to flash and then put it all back together.
